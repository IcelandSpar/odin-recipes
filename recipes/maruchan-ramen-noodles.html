  <h3>A Corn Dog with... <em>Ramen</em>?</h3>
    <p>A Corn Dog without corn? So it can't be called a corn dog. We can call it a hot dog for now! These are batter coated (just like American corn dogs) but the Korean coating is sweet-savory, flour based batter instead. The crunch will come from the crispy toppings. These Korean Hot Dogs are "deliciously crunchy, golden, and mouthwatering" and it comes from the vibrant South Korean street food culture.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Hot dogs</li>
      <li>Cheese</li>
      <li><em><strong>Uncooked Instant Ramen Noodles?</strong></em></li>
      <li><em><strong>Cheetos?</strong></em></li>
      <li>Potatoes</li>
      <li>Panko breadcrumbs</li>
      <li>Flour</li>
      <li>Milk</li>
      <li>Egg</li>
      <li>Sugar and salt</li>
      <li>Baking Poweder</li>
      <li>Sauces</li>
      <li>Skewers</li>
    </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Fill a skillet or saucepan with about 2 inches of oil in a skillet or white saucepan over high heat. If you have a digital thermometer, make sure the oil gets to 350 F. If you don't have a thermometer, your oil is ready when it starts to shimmer. I've never tried making these in an air fryer, but it's worth a shot.</li>
      <li>Skewer the hot dogs and cheese, putting 1/2 hotdog and 1/2 cheese stick on each skewer, then dip each skewer into the batter.</li>
      <li>Roll the battered skewer in your choice of coating (Cheetos, Ramen, potatoes, panko). Use your hands to firmly press everything into the batter so that it sticks.</li>
      <li>Fry the skewers in the oil, turning to keep the coating on and cook evenly on all sides until they are golden brown and crisp.</li>
      <li>Serve hot with desired dipping sauces!</li>
    </ol>
