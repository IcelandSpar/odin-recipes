  <h3>Cheesy Restaurant-like Spinach pizza</h3>
    <p>This pizza recipe is "fairly easy" to make! You can either buy premade crust or you can make you own crust which should taste many times better and offers a feeling of accomplishment after making all of it by yourself. The recipe will have a chewy crust that is also crispy on the bottom and will be very delicious by the end of this recipe!</p>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Cook Garlic and Spinach</strong> - Cook the <em>minced garlic</em> and <em>spinach</em> in <em>oilve oil</em> until spinach is wilted.</li>
      <li><strong>Make Alfredo Sauce</strong> - Melt <em>butter</em> and saute <em>garlic</em>, then whisk in <em>flour</em> until the <em>flour</em> is golden in color. Whisk the <em>milk</em> in <em>cream</em> and once it starts to thicken add <em>Parmesan cheese</em> and seasonings.</li>
      <li><strong>Prep</strong> - Preheat the oven and grease a round pizza pan or sheet pan with <em>olive oil</em> or cooking spray.</li>
      <li><strong>Make Dough</strong> - Make the pizza dough by combining <em>warm water</em> with the <em>yeast</em> and <em>sugar</em> in the bowl of a stand mixer. Let it stand until foamy, then add the <em>flour</em>, <em>oil</em>, and <em>salt</em>. Mix together using the dough hook until a smooth ball forms. Let rest for 5 minutes. No kneading necessary!</li>
      <li><strong>Assemble Pizza</strong> - Press the dough into a large circle on the greased pan and roll the edges slightly to form the crust. Spread <em>Alfredo sauce</em> onto the crust, top with <em>spinach</em>, and sprinkle <em>mozzarella</em>.</li>
      <li><strong>Bake Pizza</strong> - Bake until the crust is golden and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
      <li><strong>Serve!</strong> - Cool for a few minutes before cutting and serving. I like to sprinkle it with <em>red pepper flakes</em> and <em>grated Parmesan</em>.</li>
